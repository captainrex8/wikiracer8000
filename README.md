# WikiRacer 8000

Wikiracer takes a starting page and an end page (as either a URL or a page title) and successfully figure out how to traverse from one to the other (or tell the user if there isnâ€™t a path). The output would be a list of pages on the path, as well as the total elapsed time to run.
