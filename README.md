# WikiRacer 8000

Wikiracer takes a starting page and an end page (as either a URL or a page title) and successfully figure out how to traverse from one to the other (or tell the user if there isnâ€™t a path). The output would be a list of pages on the path, as well as the total elapsed time to run.

## High-level architecture overview


## What the code does


## Instructions for how to run your Wikiracer

To start, obtain the source code from the following repository through git clone:

`git clone https://github.com/captainrex8/wikiracer8000.git`

Make sure you have *docker*, *docker-compose* and *make*.

The first step is to run the tests by running `make test`. This will build the test container and run the unit tests.

Then you could launch the application container by running `make build-run`.

Once you have the main application container up and running. You could check to see if the application is running by making a call to the ping endpoint using the following curl command:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request GET \
  http://localhost:8089/api/v1/ping
```

If the application is running successfully, you should get a json response like this: `{"data":{"message":"I am still alive!"}}`

Unfortunately, I did not have time to build a UI to interact with the primary race API. I'd recommend using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). If not, the following curl command would initiate the search from Giant sloth to Sloth:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"from":"Giant sloth","to":"Sloth"}' \
  http://localhost:8089/api/v1/race
```

You should get the follwoing response given the wiki pages hasn't changed much: `{"data":{"fromTitle":"Giant sloth","toTitle":"Sloth","path":["Giant sloth","Ground sloth","Sloth"]}}`

## References

*make* commands:

`make test` - This will build and launch the docker container to run the jest unit tests

`make run` - This will run the docket container using docker-compose up

`make build-run` - This will build the docker container with the main application and then run the docket container using docker-compose up. By default, the running application should be accessible through port 8089 on localhost.

`make stop` - This will stop the docker container using docker-compose down

*yarn/npm* script targets:

`yarn start` - This will start the application on your host machine

`yarn lint` - This will check your code style against ESLint rules

`yarn test` - This will check code style first and then run unit tests with code coverage report
